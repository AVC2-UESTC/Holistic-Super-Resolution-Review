## 1. FISRnet (AAAI'20)
* Paper: https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/6788

* Contribution
1. Proposed a multi-scale temporal loss to regularize the spatio-temporal resolution.
2. Propsed a network increase the frames and the resolution simultaneously.

## 2. Chan et.al (AAAI'21)
* Paper: https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/16181

* Contribution
1. Exploring the mechanism of deformable alianment in video super-resolution. 
2. Comparing with flow-based alignment, the key difference is in their offset diversity.
3. Based on the observation, the authors propose a offset-fidelity loss to control the offset learning.

## 3. RISTN (AAAI'19)
* Paper: https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/4550

* Contribution
1. Proposed a residual invertible block to extract spatial information more efficiently. 
2. Introduce a sparse strategy to fuse spatial-temporal features to improve the perfomance.
